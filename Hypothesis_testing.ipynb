    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",

    "Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    "Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units\n",
    "Assignment Tasks:\n",
    "1. State the Hypotheses statement:\n",
    "2. Calculate the Test Statistic:\n",
    "Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic (t):\n",

    "σ = 5*25 units\n",
    "n = sample size (25 restaurants)\n",
    "3. Determine the Critical Value:\n",
    "Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05), determine the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table.\n",
    "4. Make a Decision:\n",
    "Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.\n",
