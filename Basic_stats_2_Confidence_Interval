 A total of 15 print-heads were randomly selected and tested until failure. The durability of each print-head (in millions of characters) was recorded as follows:
1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29


a. Build 99% Confidence Interval  Using Sample Standard Deviation
Assuming the sample is representative of the population, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before the print-head fails using the sample standard deviation. Explain the steps you take and the rationale behind using the t-distribution for this task.


x=[1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29]

#Lower bound with 99% C.I
C_I=x_bar-t*(st_dev/math.sqrt(n))
C_I 

#Upper bound with 99% C.I
C_I=x_bar+t*(st_dev/math.sqrt(n))
C_I

b. Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation
If it were known that the population standard deviation is 0.2 million characters, construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before failure.



Pop_st_dev=0.2 

#Lower bound with 99% C.I, Using Known Population Standard Deviation
C_I=x_bar-t*(Pop_st_dev/math.sqrt(n))
C_I

#Upper bound with 99% C.I, Using Known Population Standard Deviation
C_I=x_bar+t*(Pop_st_dev/math.sqrt(n))
C_I
